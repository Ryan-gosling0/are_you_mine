    <h1>15:15 pm I wonder if we think of each other at the same time.</h1>
    <main><h3 id="lp">->I poured my heart for you , You hugged me close .i want more . Write me me back  give me a reason to love  . A reason to live . How can i live with the thought of you not being mine . Or let someone else touch your hair and feel your soft arm . I want that just for me . Just imagining this can burn my body in agony .What do i desire you may ask, well i want what every man wants, i want to be her company i want to stare at her all fucking day, lay my head on her thighs and stare at the sky smiling because i know is all i need is. I love her eyes and how pretty they are  . I love her nose,cheeks. I love how she walks ,how she laughs. How she makes me feel happy to see her.  [20 dec .Its 15:15 pm] and my heart is still beating fast . Today i achieved what i wouldn't even dare to imagine . I kissed the prettiest girl i knew .</p>
